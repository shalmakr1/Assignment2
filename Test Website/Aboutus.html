The web browser serves as a doorway to the Internet for much of a typical user's online activity.
Common privacy concerns come up when simply browsing the web. Browsers provide common tools enabling users to interact with remote servers in a secure fashion, <b>1)</b> Encrypted sessions (SSL) <b>2)</b> Signed Certificates. <br><br>One need a trustworthy access to internet. Some misleading websites try to cause harm to user in term of security by following ways: <b>1-</b> Malicious sites trying to use a forged identity that are often related to phishing attacks
<b>2-</b> More elaborate impersonation attacks are also possible using JavaScript
<b>3-</b> Again, all technically legitimate JavaScript commands, used with the intention of misleading the user. Then to increase the privacy of users, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed a policy with the name of Privacy Preferences Project (P3P). It offers an easy way for web sites to communicate and enables the development of tools. It checks the website in following steps: <b>First Step: </b> name and contact information for site 
<b>Second Step: </b> kind of access provided
<b>Third Step: </b> mechanisms for resolving privacy disputes
<b>Fourth Step: </b> kinds of data collected.<br/>
Infact, Browsers should trade off security for compatibility.
